#+title: Notes about running FreeBSD on WYSE 3040

* Stuff i had to do to boot this thing

To boot the installer, i used the Freebsd 13.1 dvd1 iso, burned to a
USB stick use the bios to select it as boot device, bios password is
`Firebox` (from dell)

freebsd 13.1 enables uart1 by default, which doesn't exist on this
hardware.  therefore, to boot you need to prevent that from getting
loaded.  In the installer, do the following
1. interrupt the bootloader, get the bootloader command line
2. type `set hint.uart.1.disabled="1"`, and then type `boot`
3. once your system is installed, to make this change permanent, open
   `/boot/device.hints` and remove all of the lines that mention
   hint.uart.1

* X11

to get X11 working
1. install `drm-kmod` (which is a bunch of intel kernel drivers)
2. add that driver to the kernel with `sysrc kld_list+=i915kms`
3. install `slim` (which is a login manager) (lightdm didn't seem to
   work for me)
4. just like linux, you can get back to the console with
   ctrl-alt-f[1-6]
5. install a window manager, and enable it for your user by setting up
   .xinitrc

* Some general FreeBSD stuff

1. you don't realize how not-posix linux tools are -- under freebsd,
   run `gmake` because it's gnu make -- bsd make doesn't do a lot of
   the same things
2. gcc isn't installed by default, freebsd uses llvm
